Thank you for submitting an issue! (I know that it takes time and effort to do so.)

Be aware, however, that issues will be closed immediately after they've been answered. This is not meant in an unfriendly way, and you can ask to reopen them if there's anything wrong with the first answer. We need to close promptly for bookkeeping; to keep track of which issues have been addressed and which are still waiting—the alternative is for open issues to be forgotten. The title of your issue might also be changed as we get a clearer idea of what the cause of the issue is.

If you're submitting a bug report, it may be necessary to include data that reproduces the bug. This can be done with a file if necessary, but a line of code that constructs a small `ak.Array` is preferable.

If you're asking a "How do I…?" question, consider [StackOverflow with the [awkward-array]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/awkward-array) tag instead. The advantage is that StackOverflow questions remain open indefinitely as a database of solutions, while GitHub issues are closed as soon as they're resolved. If you think your question might lead to changes in the next version of Awkward Array, post it here; otherwise, post it to StackOverflow.

Feel free to switch the label from "bug" to "docs," "feature," "performance," "policy" as you see fit. Thanks again!
