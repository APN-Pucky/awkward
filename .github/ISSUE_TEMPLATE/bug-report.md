Thank you for submitting an issue! (I know that it takes time and effort to do so.)

Note that I'll be closing the issue as soon as I propose a solution. This is not meant to be unfriendly; it's for bookkeeping. If you think the first solution is unsatisfactory, please do continue the thread and I'll reopen it or otherwise address it.

It may be necessary to include data that reproduces the bug, as a file if necessary but preferably a minimal `ak.Array` constructor.
